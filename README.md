## Installation

1. Clone or download the bot files
2. Download and Install node.js and NPM (usually comes in one package)
3. Download and install Python 2.7
4. Download and Install ffmpeg

5. Configure `npm` and install the project dependencies
    ```sh 
    $ npm config set python python2.7
    $ npm install discord.js fs canvas request node-opus simple-youtube-api ytdl-core node-ddg translate-google moment better-sqlite3 rss-emitter-ts curl html-to-text pirate-speak steam-searcher
    ```

6. Change `./set/prefix.txt` to
    ```
    !
    ```

7. Change `./config.json` to
    ```json
    {
        "token": "DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN",
        "yandex": "YANDEX_KEY",
        "youtubekey": "YOUTUBE_API_KEY",
        "linuxhints": [""]
    }
    ```

8. Time to start the bot for the very first time.  
  You can quit the bot with ctrl+c.
    ```sh
    while true; do node index.js; done
    ```

9. The database should have been setup now too.  
  The first time you speak in a server with the bot it will prompt you to type in your discord chat:
    ```
    install auto
    ```
  This will setup a few basic channels the bot needs to function properly.

## Commands
*A small rundown of how some commands work.*

### Admin Commands
- `!add`, [admin] Give a user points or take them  
    ```
    !add @mention XX
    ```
    You can also use `!add @mention -XX` to substract points.

- `!channelmanage`, [admin] Manage preset channels  
    ```

    My own command to quickly change the code in the bot.

- `!rolemanage`, [admin] Manage self assignable roles  
    ```
    !rolemanage roleID

    This will add or take away the role from the database, depending on if it was there already.
